This is an extremely cool music player, which keep randomly plays songs from your local audio resources on your selected EQ.
For those in need, it also contains a very cool guitar tuner(E4, B3, G3, D3, A2, E2).
The most attractive thing about this App is the simple and elegant modern style "six square" layout.
PL = PLAY
SK = SKIP
PS = PAUSE
ST = STOP
TN = TUNER

To manipulate the MIDI, you need to have a android-midi-libv2-1 library to play 
with the Tuner.
